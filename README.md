# :santa: Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. This repository contains my code used to solve those puzzles.

## :dart: Approach & Problem-Solving Strategy
For each puzzle, I generally follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Break the problem down into smaller parts and understand the input.
2. **Plan the Solution**: Identify which algorithms or data structures are best suited for the task.
3. **Write the Code**: Implement the solution in a clear and efficient manner (most of the time :wink:).
4. **Verify the Result**: Ensure that it works correctly by verifying the result.

## :wrench: Tools & Technologies

## :gift: Season's Greetings from the Code

This code is intended to solve specific puzzles and challenges,
not to demonstrate best practices, elegance, or perfection in coding.

It may not follow industry-standard conventions or be optimized for
performance or readability. The primary goal of this repository is
to provide a functional solution to the given puzzles, rather than
producing "pretty" or "perfect" code. Please feel free to use, modify,
or improve it, but understand that its purpose is to offer a direct
solution to the task at hand.

## :tada: Special Thanks
A big thank you to [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz), the creator of Advent of Code, for creating and maintaining such a fantastic and fun programming challenge. The puzzles not only provide a fun way to sharpen coding skills but also bring together a vibrant and supportive community of programmers every year. Your hard work and dedication are truly appreciated, and Advent of Code has become a beloved tradition for many of us. Thanks for inspiring us to keep coding and solving problems!
